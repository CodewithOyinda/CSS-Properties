        My name is <b>Adegoke Deborah Oyindamola</b>. Technology they say-<i>"Never
        stops evolving"</i>. After carefully evaluating my abilities, i decided to
        widen and reform my knowledge and aspiration to advance my career. My
        Journey into <b>Tech</b> started in the month of <i>June, 2022 </i>during
        my NYSC. My friend introduced me to her school <b>CodeLearnGrow</b>, and
        since then I have been fascinated and eager to learn more about lines of
        codes that could build a whole website and many more. I wish to gather
        more experiences on software development to assist businesses in
        automating processes and make a difference in the world at large.

        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. It is used for website layout in
        design and used alongside HTML. CSS is a styling language. There are 3
        types/methods of adding CSS to your HTML, they are: <b>In Line CSS, Internal CSS </b>and<b> External CSS</b>. For the Inline CSS, <i>you add your CSS styling in the opening tag of your HTML Elements as
        a style attribute,</i>. The Internal styling is done by <i>adding your CSS using style tag within your html file but inside of
        the head element</i>. In the External CSS styling, <i>an external file is used to define the styling in this method for any HTML page.</i>

        In web development, the CSS box model refers to how HTML elements are
        modeled in browser engines and how the dimensions of those HTML elements
        are derived from CSS properties. <b>Boarder</b> <i>is used to set the
        border on an element.</i> <b>Padding</b> <i>refers to the space between the element content and the element border. <b>Margin</b> <i>is used to define the space around elements. It clears an area around
          the element.</i>
